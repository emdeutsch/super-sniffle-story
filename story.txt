Once upon a time there was a bear named Ted. He lived in the forest but was never able to make friends because all of the animals were scared of him. All of the other bears in the forest were big and scary but Ted was small and friendly. Despite this, the other kids were scared of him and he did not fit in anywhere.
Ted tried his best to fit in with the other bears. He tried to join in their games, and even won a couple competitions to see who could climb the tree the highest. Yet - nothing worked. All the other bears just saw him as a small bear. "How could small bears be so scary?" he would ask his mom.
