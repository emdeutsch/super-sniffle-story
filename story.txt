Once upon a time there was a bear named Ted. He lived in the forest but was never able to make friends because all of the animals were scared of him. All of the other bears in the forest were big and scary but Ted was small and friendly. Despite this, the other kids were scared of him and he did not fit in anywhere.
Ted tried his best to fit in with the other bears. He tried to join in their games, and even won a couple competitions to see who could climb the tree the highest. Yet - nothing worked. All the other bears just saw him as a small bear. "How could small bears be so scary?" he would ask his mom.
"Well Ted" she replied, "Many generations ago there was a tiny bear just like you and his name was Freddy, but Freddy was not friendly to the other animals. Freddy also got excluded by the big bears just because he was small so he got very angry. As a result, Freddy took his anger out on all the little bunnies and squirrels in the forrest. Since then, no little bear has ever been trusted by the other animals."
But then she went on to explain, that he could be the first small bear to defy these stereotypes that Freddy had set years ago. Ted could be the first small bear in years to be trusted by the other animals. All he had to do to achieve this was be confident and friendly!
So Ted spent the rest of his life dedicating himself to fixing the image of small bears. 40 years later, when Ted was all grown up and had cubs of his own, his life of compassion had completely altered the view of small bears and his kind were now cherished and his children were free to p;lay with whoeber they pleased. The End.
